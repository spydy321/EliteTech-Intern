# EliteTech-Intern
A Python program for Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption.
## Main Features
- Encryption and Decryption Modes:

Allows users to choose between encrypting and decrypting a message, providing a straightforward interface for both operations.
- Custom Shift Value:

Users can specify a shift value (0-25) that determines how far each letter is shifted in the alphabet. This flexibility allows for customized encryption levels and makes it easy to experiment with different cipher shifts.
Case-Sensitive Encoding:

Retains the case of each letter (upper or lower) in the encrypted or decrypted text, ensuring the output is readable and formatted similarly to the input.
- Non-Alphabet Character Preservation:

Non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces, punctuation, and numbers) are preserved in their original form, allowing for accurate and formatted output without modification.
- Immediate Processing:

Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message immediately, so users get instant feedback on their input and can quickly verify the result.
Simple, CLI-Based Interface:

Operates entirely from the command line, making it lightweight, accessible, and easy to use on systems like Kali Linux.
Educational Tool:

Offers a practical introduction to the principles of encryption and cryptography, making it ideal for beginners interested in learning more about basic security techniques in a hands-on way.
